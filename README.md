# Just Education

This repository represents a dream I have for the future of education: 

> Individualized education paths fit for royalty

## Vision

The goal of **Just Education** is to create an intelligent platform to provide individualized pathways of education for users. This platform will be created with a variety of technologies and human capital.

## Current Build

- [Interest survey](./interest-survey)

## Hypotheses & Validation

- This platform can complement with any schooling (public K12, private college, adult self-learning)
- This platform can get access to important student data (GPA, classes, etc.)
- Students are motivated but directionless
- AI/ML recommendations can help with building student pathways
- No new educational content will need to be made, just direction
- There will be access to tutors who can help build pathways and guide students

## Current progress

March 30, 2022 - Just beginning. I need to start as analog and learn. My first thought is to offer services to some local families and see what sort of thing this can be. What are the key activities the platform should perform, what technologies do I need, what human capital is needed.
